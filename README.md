This project outlines a widely researched method of Branch Prediction, Perceptrons. Perceptrons are a widely known aspect of Machine Learning, which is why their introduction into Branch Prediction has truly transformed the way we work with branch prediction algorithms. The main idea when introduced was to use one of the simplest possible neural networks as an alternative to the commonly used two-bit counters. This predictor proved to show an overall improvement in accuracy by utilizing various different methods such as increasing its size and using long branch histories. When Machine Learning was first introduced into the Branch Prediction realm, it was thought to be irrational due to its high latency and cost, but in recent years it has become the most widely utilized of any.
 
This prompted the recreation of the Perceptron predictor where we wanted to evaluate it in numerous different fashions to determine where it performs best and also where its shortcomings lie. The experiments and research done within this project will outline a more solid understanding of Perceptrons within Branch Prediction, but also provide additional directions this neural network could take in the future.
