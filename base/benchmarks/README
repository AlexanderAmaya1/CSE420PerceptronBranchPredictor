In this folder you have 4 PARSEC benchmarks and 2 SPLASH2 benchmarks:
    * blackscholes 
    * bodytrack
    * ferret 
    * fluidanimate
    * cholesky
    * fft

If you look at the bash scripts (*.sh files), you will see how they call different binaries on different datasets.
Parsec and Splash2 benchmarks offer datasets of different sizes- you might want instrument binaries with larger
datasets, and run simulations on smaller datasets. 

Right now, all the scripts are using the smallest dataset available.
By uncommenting other lines, you can run the benchmarks on full datasets.
